                "The refugee problem is a really big problem for every country in the world. All people should have the same living conditions from the beginning of their lives. Some people are lucky enough to be born in really good living conditions. Like being able to have a proper education, having a roof to live under, and more. But as the same amount of these lucky people, there are the same amount of unlucky people in this world. They can not afford to have proper education and even they can not afford to have a stable life under a roof. They have to leave their houses because of the wars around their living areas or because of the lack of food or water.\n\nIn the country you live in maybe you can have a 15 minute long shower but in some countries in Africa they can not find enough water to drink. Again when we are sick we can go to the doctors and reach for medicine but some people die just because of a simple flu because of the lack of health support.\n\nThese examples are really simple daily things for us and for the other 40 percent of humanity they are hard to reach. There are some solutions for these 40 percent of humanity. one of the primary solutions is to immigrate to other countries which have better living conditions. If they immigrate enough to some higher-level living condition city or country they can have the same living conditions as the rest of us. But in our century some countries do not accept refugees. Even from their neighbors. With this decision, they turn down many hopeless people so their citizens can have higher qualified lives. Many people from Europe, America, and Asia fight for the right of these people. As world citizens, we should not be silent about these topics. Even if you do not think about other peoplealways remember that life is not always going to stay positive for us and someday in the future, we may be in the same situation asthem. Before experiencing this horrible situation and living conditions we should start to legalize refugee acceptance and have an even word and fair life for every living person."),

In these “small” communities, you might exchange ideas with a friend or help out a coworker with a problem.\nBeing a global citizen simply means having a willingness to do this with people from different nations and cultural backgrounds.You may feel like you don’t have enough to offer. It’s tempting to think you have to travel to a new country every month or fight for social justice to define yourself as a “global citizen.” This misses the mark.\nThe global citizen definition you should use is more about being connected and garnering an understanding of cultures beyond your own. This looks different for different people. What does it mean to be a global citizen for you? It could start with something as simple as researching a new country or making friends with an immigrant neighbor. It could end with traveling abroad and contributing to community efforts to advance education, health, or environmental conservation. Working to solve our shared global challenges is so important, and this drive to make a positive impact is most effective when it stems from the feeling of global citizenship and being a member of an international community.So then, how does one become a global citizen or improve their global citizenship skills? \nWhat do you have to do in order to get this kind of global education and world mindset? When people make the decision to become global citizens, they have already made a step in the right direction towards expanding their global awareness, but there are some things — both small and large — that you personally can do to create global citizenship in your own life.

This shift is every bit as transformative as the initial adoption of fossil fuel–powered machines and electricity. And the move toward “net zero”—emitting no more greenhouse gases than are removed1—needs to unfold with an urgency that exceeds previous industrial revolutions.2 The global economy is being remade, and every business, government, organization, and individual has a role to play in accelerating this transition.A growing array of businesses and governments are, indeed, confronting climate change, announcing emissions goals and climate initiatives daily. While worthy in and of themselves, these efforts are often focused narrowly on the organization’s own operations. What’s needed is a more holistic system of systems approach that unlocks critical opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy by working at the intersection of emerging low-carbon initiatives.The system-of-systems approach recognizes that existing industries will be reconstituted as a series of complex, interconnected, emissions-free systems—energy, mobility, industry and manufacturing, agriculture and land use, and negative emissions. Government, finance, and technology can play a catalytic role to underpin and enable the emergence of those systems. A diverse set of societal and economic forces—from fluid and shifting consumer preferences to the rise of stakeholder capitalism and growing demands for climate action now—can drive the transition."),
